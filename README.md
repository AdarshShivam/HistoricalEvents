Testing Historical Events
This project contains unit tests for the getHistoricalEvents function in historicalEvents.mjs.

Project extensions have been changed to mjs to handle module mismatch issues.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed
NPM for package management

Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
npm install mocha
npm install chai

2. Run the test cases
npm test
or
npm run test

This will execute the test cases in test.js using the Mocha test framework.

Writing Test Cases
The test cases use Mocha and Chai for assertions. Some key points:

Describe test suite using describe()
Individual tests using it()
Use expect for assertions

New test cases can be added to test.mjs.
